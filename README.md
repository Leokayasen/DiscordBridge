# DiscordBridge
DiscordBridge is a plugin that allows seamless integration between Discord and other platforms. It enables users to connect their Discord servers with Minecraft.

Start by looking at the code in the `v1.1.0` branch, and use the Fork option to create a copy in your own account.

> [!WARNING]
> There is a vital notice in the README in `v1.1.0` - it is highly recommended that you read it carefully.
